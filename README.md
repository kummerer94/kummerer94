### Hi, I'm Alexander.

I am currently working for [finccam](https://finccam.com) as an Investment Engineer. Before, I studied [Finance and Information Management](http://www.fim-master.de/) at [TUM](https://tum.de). Coming from a background in [theoretical analysis](https://xkcd.com/435/), I pursued my education in financial mathematics through the Elite Graduate Program FIM and deepened my understanding of financial markets.

I try to make life easier for investment advisors and portfolio managers by leveraging cloud technologies in an asset management context. Find out more about my personal projects on my [website](http://akammerer.de/) or look at my [cv](http://akammerer.de/cv.pdf).

As for my personal life, I am eagerly interested in politics and literature. I love the music of the [Black Keys](https://open.spotify.com/artist/7mnBLXK823vNxN3UWB7Gfz) and the cantatas of [Bach](https://open.spotify.com/artist/5aIqB5nVVvmFsvSdExz408).
